# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the student data shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The school board believes that the reading and math grades among 9th graders at Thomas High School have been altered. Although the board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. In turn, Maria has asked us to assist with her task. She wants us to replace the math and reading scores for all 9th graders at Thomas High School with "NaNs" while keeping the rest of the data intact. After that we are to run the school analysis again to see how the omission of the 9th grader data at Thomas High School has affected the overall analysis.
